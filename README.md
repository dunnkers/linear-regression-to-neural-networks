Tutorial taking you from simple statistical methods to sophisticated Machine Learning methods such as Neural Networks. Available on a [web page](https://dunnkers.com/linear-regression-to-neural-networks).

## Usage
In order to run the Notebooks yourself, install the following packages and run a Notebook environment:

```shell
pip install numpy pandas seaborn sklearn tqdm
